Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Marketing at the [Mendoza College of Business](https://mendoza.nd.edu/), University of Notre Dame. I got my Ph.D. in Business Administration (Marketing) from the Texas A&M University’s Mays Business School, under the supervision of [Hari Sridhar](https://mays.tamu.edu/directory/shriharisridhar/) (Texas A&M University) and [Vikas Mittal](https://business.rice.edu/person/vikas-mittal) (Rice University). 

I study the social impact of marketing interventions, with a goal of measuring and improving the effectiveness of marketing spending for social sector organizations such as health care institutions and school districts. I am also interested in quantifying the return on investment in the context of digital markets such as social media. To study these questions, I use the tools developed in applied econometrics, causal inference, and machine learning. My [research](research.html) has been published in the ***Journal of Marketing***, featured in ***Harvard Business Review***, and selected as a finalist for the MSI/H. Paul Root Award. 

At Notre Dame, I will be [teaching](teaching.html) Marketing Analytics at the undergraduate and graduate level. During my doctoral studies, I have taught Marketing Analytics to the undergraduate students at Mays, winning the Dean’s Award for Outstanding Teaching.
