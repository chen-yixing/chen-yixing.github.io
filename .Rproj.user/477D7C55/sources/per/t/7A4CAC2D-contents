Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of [Marketing](https://mendoza.nd.edu/research-faculty/academic-departments/marketing/) at the [Mendoza College of Business](https://mendoza.nd.edu/) and a faculty affiliate of the [Eck Institute for Global Health (EIGH)](https://globalhealth.nd.edu/) and the [Mike and Josie Harper Cancer Research Institute (HCRI)](https://harpercancer.nd.edu/) , University of Notre Dame. I got my Ph.D. in Business Administration (Marketing) from the Texas A&M University’s Mays Business School, under the supervision of [Hari Sridhar](https://mays.tamu.edu/directory/shriharisridhar/) (Texas A&M University) and [Vikas Mittal](https://business.rice.edu/person/vikas-mittal) (Rice University). 

I study the social impact of marketing interventions, with a goal of measuring and improving the effectiveness of marketing spending for social sector organizations such as health care institutions and school districts. I am also interested in quantifying the return on investment in the context of digital markets such as social media. To study these questions, I use the tools developed in applied econometrics, causal inference, and machine learning. My [research](research.html) has been published in the ***Journal of Marketing*** and ***Journal of Marketing Research***, featured in ***Harvard Business Review***, and selected as the recipient of the 2021 John A. Howard/AMA Doctoral Dissertation Award and a finalist for the 2018 MSI/H. Paul Root Award. 

At Notre Dame, I [teach](teaching.html) Marketing Analytics at the undergraduate and graduate level. During my doctoral studies, I have taught Marketing Analytics to the undergraduate students at Mays, winning the Dean’s Award for Outstanding Teaching.
