Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of [Marketing](https://mendoza.nd.edu/research-faculty/academic-departments/marketing/) at the [Mendoza College of Business](https://mendoza.nd.edu/) and a faculty affiliate of the [Mike and Josie Harper Cancer Research Institute ](https://harpercancer.nd.edu/), [Lucy Family Institute for Data & Society](https://lucyinstitute.nd.edu/about/), and [Eck Institute for Global Health](https://globalhealth.nd.edu/) at the University of Notre Dame. I am an Advisory Fellow for the Product & Data Science Group at [GreatSchools.org](https://www.greatschools.org/), the leading nonprofit in K-12 education. I serve on the editorial review boards of the ***Journal of Marketing*** and ***Journal of Marketing Research***.

I study the social impact of marketing, with a focus on measuring and enhancing the effectiveness of marketing interventions for social sector organizations, particularly in health and education. I also collaborate with digital platforms (e.g., search, social media, e-commerce, and online review platforms) to assess the value of data, algorithms, and choice architecture. My work spans marketing, information systems, operations management, and medicine, with articles published or forthcoming in premier journals such as ***Journal of Marketing***, ***Journal of Marketing Research***,  ***Management Science***,  ***Production and Operations Management***, and  ***Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology***. My research has been honored with [Financial Times Responsible Business Academic Research Award](https://www.ft.com/content/d5ca2a09-333b-4f86-9e99-3a3bf1b86c75), [AMA-EBSCO-RRBM Award for Responsible Research in Marketing (2023 Distinguished Winner)](https://www.ama.org/press-releases/ama-ebsco-rrbm-award-for-responsible-research-in-marketing-2023-winners-announced/), and [John A. Howard/AMA Doctoral Dissertation Award](https://www.ama.org/john-a-howard-ama-doctoral-dissertation-award/) ([acceptance speech](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11XeDOTi3L4zf0K81VP3sTyOgivz-lghf/view)) and named a finalist for prestigious best paper awards such as the Paul E. Green Award, AMA/Marketing Science Institute/H. Paul Root Award (×2), and AMA-EBSCO-RRBM Award for Responsible Research in Marketing. 

I am passionate about teaching and have been recognized as one of [*Poets & Quants* Best 40-Under-40 MBA Professors Worldwide](https://poetsandquants.com/2023/06/05/2023-best-40-under-40-mba-professors-yixing-chen-mendoza-college-of-business-university-of-notre-dame/). At Mendoza, I teach Marketing Analytics in the undergraduate and MBA programs where I received the Prochaska Outstanding Teaching Award. During my doctoral studies, I taught Marketing Analytics and won the Dean’s Award for Outstanding Teaching.
