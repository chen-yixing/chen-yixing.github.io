Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of [Marketing](https://mendoza.nd.edu/research-faculty/academic-departments/marketing/) at the [Mendoza College of Business](https://mendoza.nd.edu/) and a faculty affiliate of the [Mike and Josie Harper Cancer Research Institute ](https://harpercancer.nd.edu/), [Lucy Family Institute for Data & Society](https://lucyinstitute.nd.edu/about/), and [Eck Institute for Global Health](https://globalhealth.nd.edu/) at the University of Notre Dame. I received my Ph.D. in Business Administration (Marketing) from the Texas A&M University’s Mays Business School, under the supervision of [Hari Sridhar](https://mays.tamu.edu/directory/shriharisridhar/) (Texas A&M University) and [Vikas Mittal](https://business.rice.edu/person/vikas-mittal) (Rice University). 

I study social impact of marketing, with a goal of measuring and improving the effectiveness of marketing spending for social sector organizations such as health care institutions and school districts. I am also interested in quantifying the return on investment in the context of digital markets. My [research](research.html) has appeared in the premier marketing and medical journals such as ***Journal of Marketing***, ***Journal of Marketing Research***, and ***Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology***. My research has been supported by the National Cancer Institute and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

Howard/AMA Doctoral Dissertation Award](https://www.ama.org/john-a-howard-ama-doctoral-dissertation-award/) ([acceptance speech](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11XeDOTi3L4zf0K81VP3sTyOgivz-lghf/view)), [Texas A&M Distinguished Dissertation Award](https://today.tamu.edu/2021/05/03/texas-am-announces-2020-21-distinguished-dissertation-award-winners/), and Grow the Good in Business Faculty Research Award at Mendoza, and was a finalist for the AMA-EBSCO-RRBM Award for Responsible Research in Marketing (2022) and AMA/Marketing Science Institute/H.
