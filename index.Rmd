Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of [Marketing](https://mendoza.nd.edu/research-faculty/academic-departments/marketing/) at the [Mendoza College of Business](https://mendoza.nd.edu/) and a faculty affiliate of the [Mike and Josie Harper Cancer Research Institute ](https://harpercancer.nd.edu/), [Lucy Family Institute for Data & Society](https://lucyinstitute.nd.edu/about/), and [Eck Institute for Global Health](https://globalhealth.nd.edu/) at the University of Notre Dame. I received my Ph.D. in Business Administration (Marketing) from the Texas A&M University’s Mays Business School, under the supervision of [Hari Sridhar](https://mays.tamu.edu/directory/shriharisridhar/) (Texas A&M University) and [Vikas Mittal](https://business.rice.edu/person/vikas-mittal) (Rice University). 

I study social impact of marketing, with an aim to measure and improve the effectiveness of marketing interventions for social sector organizations (e.g., health care and education). I am also interested in studying algorithmic accountability and quantifying return on investment in the context of digital markets. My research has appeared in the premier marketing and medical journals such as ***Journal of Marketing***, ***Journal of Marketing Research***, and ***Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology***. My research has been supported by the National Cancer Institute and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. I won the [Financial Times Responsible Business Education Academic Research Award](https://www.ft.com/content/d5ca2a09-333b-4f86-9e99-3a3bf1b86c75), [John A. Howard/AMA Doctoral Dissertation Award](https://www.ama.org/john-a-howard-ama-doctoral-dissertation-award/) ([acceptance speech](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11XeDOTi3L4zf0K81VP3sTyOgivz-lghf/view)), [University of New Mexico Inspirational Young Alumnus Award](https://news.unm.edu/news/alumni-association-announces-2022-unm-alumni-award-recipients), [Texas A&M Distinguished Dissertation Award](https://today.tamu.edu/2021/05/03/texas-am-announces-2020-21-distinguished-dissertation-award-winners/), and Grow the Good in Business Faculty Research Award at Mendoza College of Business, and was a finalist for best paper awards such as the AMA-EBSCO-RRBM Award for Responsible Research in Marketing (2022), Paul E. Green Award (2021), and AMA/Marketing Science Institute/H. Paul Root Award (2018 and 2020). 

At Notre Dame, I teach Marketing Analytics at the undergraduate and graduate level. During my doctoral studies, I have taught Marketing Analytics to the undergraduate students at the Mays Business School, winning the Dean’s Award for Outstanding Teaching.
