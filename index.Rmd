Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of [Marketing](https://mendoza.nd.edu/research-faculty/academic-departments/marketing/) at the [Mendoza College of Business](https://mendoza.nd.edu/) and a faculty affiliate of the [Mike and Josie Harper Cancer Research Institute ](https://harpercancer.nd.edu/), [Lucy Family Institute for Data & Society](https://lucyinstitute.nd.edu/about/), and [Eck Institute for Global Health](https://globalhealth.nd.edu/) at the University of Notre Dame. 

I study social impact of marketing, with an aim to measure and improve the effectiveness of marketing interventions for social sector organizations (e.g., health care and education). I am also interested in measuring the value of data, algorithms, and choice architecture in digital markets (e.g., search engine, social media, e-commerce, and online review platforms). My research has appeared in premier marketing and medical journals such as ***Journal of Marketing***, ***Journal of Marketing Research***, and ***Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology***. My research has been supported by National Cancer Institute, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and Kemper Foundation.

My research has also been selected as a finalist for prestigious best paper awards such as the AMA-EBSCO-RRBM Award for Responsible Research in Marketing (2022), Paul E. Green Award (2021), and AMA/Marketing Science Institute/H. Paul Root Award (2018 and 2020).
